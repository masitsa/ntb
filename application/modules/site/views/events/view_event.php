	                        	Through the International Standards on Auditing (ISAs) Clarity Project, audit firms and practitioners are encouraged to consider implementation issues as soon as practicable. This will ensure that those charged with responsibilities relating to audits of financial statements make adjustments to current audit programs and procedures to reflect these changes.
								The ISAs introduced significant changes to audit standards thus making it challenging not just to audit seniors but staff as well.
								With target to staff of audit firms, this workshop will take a practical approach to audit in consideration of special circumstances in which the audited entities operate.
								Key areas to be covered include:
								Audit Planning and Risk Assessment Process
								- Key phases of the audit plan
								- Basic requirements of risk assessment procedures
								Conducting Analytical Procedures and Audit Sampling
								Audit of Financial Statements
								Audit Completion
								ICPAK Code of Ethics: Ethics and the CPA
								The workshop will be held at the Western Branch (Kakamega) on 17th â€“ 18th February 2015. The exact venue shall be communicated in due course. Charges are Kshs. 7, 950 and Kshs. 9, 950 for members and non-members respectively. Members in attendance will earn 14 CPD Hours.  Staff who are not ICPAK members with proof of working in member audit firms will enjoy the member rate.
